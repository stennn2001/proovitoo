Test Assignment 1

As a user I want use command line tool to parse file of urls and see http status code and how many seconds the request took.

Command line tool has options -i <input-file>

Input file is csv file with separator pipe, example of a file

Neti|http://www.neti.ee

Google|http://www.google.com

 

CSV first column is name and second is url.

As a user I want to see the http status code and request time(2 decimals) in console like this

./download.py -i urls.csv

“Neti”, HTTP 200, time 0.51 seconds

“Google”, HTTP 200, time 0.60 seconds

 

option -h will show the help of the script.

If page is not reachable in 3 seconds print "Skipping <url>"

To parse command line arguments use click https://pypi.org/project/click/
